- Background color: Desaturated dark blue (#293462) to provide contrast with the gold.
- Accent color: Bright blue (#1E90FF) to complement the gold and create visual interest.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for an elegant, high-end feel; body text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif).
- Use icons inspired by Egyptian hieroglyphs and symbols for navigation and branding.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout that evokes the grandeur of ancient Egyptian design, but with a modern touch.
- Subtle animations such as glowing edges around the headdress to add a futuristic Anubis aesthetic.
